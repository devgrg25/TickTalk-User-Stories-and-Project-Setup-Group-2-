For visually impaired commuters who encounter regular issues with road signs, maps, and transport apps that use small text
or color cues, VisionRoute is a mobile app that offers real-time speech-accessible travel guidance.
Unlike traditional navigation tools like google maps that overlook accessibility, VisionRoute is specifically designed for blind
and low-vision users. It has features like audio-haptic announcements, automated reminders for personalized routes, and
maps to assist and make each step of the journey easier to follow.
