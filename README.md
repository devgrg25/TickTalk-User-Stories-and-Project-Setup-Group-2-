# TickTalk
An accessibility-focused timer app for blind and low vision users. 

Produt Vision:
For blind and visually impaired individuals who rely on structured routines, TickTalk is a mobile timer app that offers voice
activated timer creation, audio-haptic feedback on remaining time at request, and the ability to design and query complex
timer routines such as repeated sets for exercise or pomodoro study. Unlike other timer apps, TickTalk allows the user to
program specific intervals at which to receive feedback instead of repeatedly having to ask how much time remains, and
create advanced timers that convey more information aloud such as current set (in the case of timed exercise).
